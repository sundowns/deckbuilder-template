# Deckbuilder Template

A reusable skeleton project for card/deck-based games in Godot. Intended to be agnostic of any actual game, just a starting point for other projects.

Implements a few basic features including:

- Extensible `Card` and `Deck` resource types
- A `CardDealerSystem`, responsible for loading decks and drawing cards
- Barebones UI to select and drag cards around the screen
