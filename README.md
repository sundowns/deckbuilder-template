# Deckbuilder Template

A reusable skeleton project for card/deck-based games in Godot. Intended to be agnostic of any actual game, just a starting point for other projects.

Implements a few basic features including:

- Extensible `Card` and `Deck` resource types
- A `CardDealerSystem`, responsible for loading decks and drawing cards
- Barebones UI to select and drag cards around the screen

This project was made in Godot 4.2beta4 with the Mobile renderer, but really its largely version agnostic. Use what makes sense for you.
